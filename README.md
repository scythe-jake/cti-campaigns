# cti-campaigns
A location to publish campaigns from the CTI team that may not have undergone full QA testing or ATT&amp;CK labeling.

Note that these campaigns are desinged to solve immediate client needs. We may at some point integrate some of these into community threats, but those have a higher standard of prepublication review. The intent of the separate repo is to make it clear which level of QA threats are being pulled from.
